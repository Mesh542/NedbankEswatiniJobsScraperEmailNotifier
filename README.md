# NedbankEswatiniJobsScraperEmailNotifier

# This program automatically fetches job listings from the Nedbank Eswatini website and sends them to a specified
# user via email (gmail). The email would have to be configured to use 2-FA and to use the privacy key that acts as a
# password. You can specify it as an environment variable or directly, but the former is more secure.
# run <pyinstaller --onefile main.py> without brackets to make .py file .exe. Pip install pyinstaller if need be
